## Introduction

This project showcases the use of several modern Web APIs to access and manipulate various features of a user's device through a web browser. It serves as a practical demonstration for developers interested in integrating these APIs into their own projects.

## Features

- **Fetch API:** Demonstrates GET and POST requests, custom headers, and error handling.
- **Web Storage API:** Demonstrates setting, getting, and removing data from Local Storage and Session Storage.
- **IndexedDB API:** Demonstrates creating a database, reading, writing, and deleting data, and populating it using Fetch API.
- **Navigator API:** Displays information about the user's browser and operating system.
- **Geolocation API:** Retrieves the geographical location of the device.
- **File API:** Allows interaction with local files, including reading and displaying their content.
- **Web Audio API:** Enables the creation and manipulation of audio content.
- **Notifications API:** Allows the web application to send notifications to the user’s device.
- **Battery Status API:** Provides information about the battery status of the device.
- **Vibration API:** Accesses the device’s vibration mechanism.
- **Fullscreen API:** Enables an element to be displayed in fullscreen mode.
- **Device Orientation API:** Provides information about the physical orientation of the device.
- **Performance API:** Provides access to high-resolution timestamps and performance metrics.

## Usage

To use this demo, simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser. The web application provides a user-friendly interface with buttons to trigger different API functionalities and display the results in a formatted manner.
